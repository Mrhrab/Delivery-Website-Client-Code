                <h1>How we evolve?</h1>
                <p>Spare a thought for food delivery drivers as we head into the winter months in the Northern Hemisphere. As most people huddle up by the fire and log on to their favorite delivery app to see what’s hot, these troopers are out delivering more orders than ever. 

The winter spike in orders, especially for hot soup and filling foods, is unsurprising when you consider the popularity of food delivery and the difficulty of moving around in the cold weather – especially in the northernmost parts of Europe and North America.

Aside from the desire for a pick-me-up in the dark and gloomy days of winter, trends also show an increasing number of holiday delivery orders year on year.

For restaurants already dealing with the busy holiday period and often struggling to keep up with delivery orders, how do you cope with this winter spike?

Below we’ll cover the best strategies to cope with excess winter delivery orders, including: 

Streamlining your menu based on winter trends

Using data you already have to optimize your menu

How to use marketing and promotions to manage order timings

Tips on how to upgrade your delivery tech and improve operations

So if you’re looking to upgrade your winter operations, read on to find out how to make the most of the winter food delivery boom.

         <h2 className="m-5">How to prepare for increase in orders</h2>
         <p>A study of ordering habits in the US during freezing temperatures, carried out by GrubHub, showed that orders for hot soups and filling foods like sandwiches get a boost in the winter months. At the same time, unsurprisingly, items described as cold or frozen see a dip in popularity. 

You might be surprised that high volume favorites like pizza slices, mac ‘n’ cheese, and chicken tacos also tend to see a dip. But comfort food is perhaps not considered healthy, and people tend to look for more wholesome options during the cold and flu season.

Analyzing data like this for your local area and streamlining your winter menu accordingly could be the difference between winter blues and delivery success. Focusing on the dishes that are likely to sell better in the colder months could help you reduce prep times while maximizing order volume.</p>

                <h4 className="m-5">Streamline your winter delivery</h4>
                <p className="m-5">Once you see what works in the real world, you can further optimize your menu to really take advantage of the seasonal trends. Take a look at your past years’ delivery data as well as monitoring orders in real-time to get a clear picture of what is selling best in the cold weather.

Analyzing data from multiple delivery partners can be a pain – logging into the different platforms, navigating different analytics dashboards, and collating all of that data into one format could add hours to your day.

Deliverect takes all your order data from every platform you use and stores it in one format. You can access all the insights from one dashboard on devices your managers are already using.

Having your delivery data at your fingertips will make a huge difference when it comes to analyzing those winter trends and maximizing your menu’s potential.</p>
