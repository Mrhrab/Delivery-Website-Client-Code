                        <h4> Biber Myth</h4>
                       <p>  Placed an order for pizza using delivery.com for the first time. They charged my card then cancelled the order due to possible fraud. Spoke to supervisor who said it was done by a third party but he had no details. I asked how they could give my information to a third party without my permission. In addition this third party wouldn't tell them why my order was canceled. I did not give my information to a third party. On top of that it may take five days to get my money back. this make me feel bad once.</p>

                        <p>Delivery.com is a great website where you can order food. It is well made and also suited for group orders in an entire office. They offer a great variety of restaurants, meals and all different kinds of food for every taste and diet. It is nice that you do not need an app like with other similar products. Besides food delivery they also offer laundry or catering, which is nice to have under one solution. If there are issues you can simply contact support through their chat..</p>

                           I use a lot of apps to order food online. However, delivery.com has the best rates when it comes to delivery fees. It has a lot of options for different cuisines and the delivery is always pretty fast. The review section of different restaurants helps me decide which restaurant do I want to order from. The feedback feature after every order is very comprehensive.</p>

                           I have been delivery.com’s biggest fan since I first used the app after being shown an advertisement on Youtube- with the $15!!!! introductory offer from Youtube, the vast selection, the great customer service. I am truly delivery.com’s biggest advocate in NYC. Everyone who knows my late night cravings, knows delivery.com.</p>

           <h4 className="m-5">How we get reviews?</h4>

           <p className="m-5">Customer reviews build something known as social proof, a phenomenon that states people are influenced by those around them. This might include friends and family, industry experts and influencers, or even internet strangers. 

Social proof can push customers who are on the fence about buying a product to make a purchase (or consider other alternatives). While there are many different forms of social proof (like influencer campaigns and company partnerships), customer reviews have a special place in shoppers’ hearts. 

Think about the last time you tried a new restaurant. Or bought a vacuum. You probably looked for reviews online first, right? When considering a purchase, people want first-hand perspectives from other people just like them. While a famous influencer might catch their attention, experiences from peers are also important if you want to convince them to buy. 

Depending on the industry your business is in, customer reviews might be especially important because they help offset a generally negative view of certain industries. For example, if you work in advertising, you’ve got a bit of an uphill battle—only 23% of respondents surveyed in the Customer Communications Review said that ad agencies provided “very good” or “pretty good” service, and ad agencies rank dead last in comparison to other major industries:</p>

       <h4 className="m-5">How to contact us?</h4>
       <p>Far too many website designers put contact pages near the bottom of their priority list in terms of copywriting and design. It’s no wonder that many contact pages look like they were built in the 1990s, while the rest of the website is beautiful and updated.

That, my friends, is a huge mistake. Your Contact Us page is one of the most valuable pages on your website. And for most companies, it's typically one of the most-visited site pages.

In this article, we’ll show you over 40 real-life examples of contact pages you can use to inspire yours.

But first, let’s review elements effective contact pages have in common to learn about the features and best practices you should remember to include in your</p>
